# ABtheta

This is for our paper AB theta test.

The file AB_theta_1d.ipynb is for the first numerical experiment in our paper, and the file AB_theta_multi_d.ipynb is for the second.

The code is not designed for parallel computing, so it may take several hours for large scale simulations. Be careful if you want to do so.

To be continued.
